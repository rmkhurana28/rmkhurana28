# ♠️ Ridham Khurana

Systems programming, compilers, and applied cryptography.  
Working on production-level C compilers and performance-critical low-level software.

## Experience
- **Summer Research Intern — Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata**  
  Worked on post-quantum cryptography, analyzing and optimizing Kyber (KEM) and Dilithium (signatures) in C under NIST security standards.

## Open-Source Contributions
- **QEMU Vector Engine — Fractional LMUL Fix**  
  [View PR](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20260125085958.47957-1-khurana.ridham222@gmail.com/)
  
- **Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator — PR #2218**  
  [View PR](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/pull/2218)

## Selected Projects
- **RMc7 — C Compiler Toolchain (In Development)**  
  [Repository](https://github.com/rmkhurana28/RMc7-Production-C-Compiler) —  
  Production-grade C compiler written in C++17, currently under development and targeting 90–95% ISO C coverage with full language and backend support.

- **RMc4 — C Compiler (Full Pipeline)**  
  [Repository](https://github.com/rmkhurana28/RM_C-Compilor) —  
  Full C compiler made in C with complete lexical analysis, deterministic parsing, typed AST construction, semantic analysis, IR generation, multi-stage optimizations, and an x86-64 backend.

## Focus Areas
- Compiler frontends, IR design, optimization passes, x86-64 code generation  
- RISC-V simulation, ISA-level analysis, performance modeling  
- Systems software, memory models, concurrency  
- Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium)
